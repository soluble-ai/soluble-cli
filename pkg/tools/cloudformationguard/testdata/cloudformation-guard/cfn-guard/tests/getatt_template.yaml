Description: 'AWS CloudFormation Sample Template for cfn-guard blog, for developers.
  It creates an Amazon EC2 instance running the latest Amazon Linux AMI, based on the region
  in which the stack is run, with restricted sizes. It also creates an EC2 security group
  for the instance to give you SSH access on a non-standard port.

  it once the stack is deployed.  Delete the stack after you have completed your tests to
  avoid additional charges'
