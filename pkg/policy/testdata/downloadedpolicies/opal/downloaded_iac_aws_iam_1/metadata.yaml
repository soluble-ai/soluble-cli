description: "Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. You can authenticate to your DB cluster using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication. IAM database cluster authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With this authentication method, you don't need to use a password when you connect to a DB cluster. Instead, you use an authentication token."
